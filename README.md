#My First Project on Github
#"enhanced_2048_Deep Version" is a modified version of the classic 2048 puzzle game. The objective is to combine tiles with the same values to create higher-value tiles until you reach the ultimate goal or as far as you can go! This version includes custom features like unlimited moves, a restart option, personalized messages, and an improved UI.
#Features Improved:
#Unlimited Moves: Play without limitations; the game wonâ€™t end when the board is full.
#Restart Option: Restart the game anytime after a game-over.
#Personalized Welcome and Ending Messages: Displays a welcome message with your username on the game page and a "Well Played" message after the game ends.
